1. Zero knowledge proofs (potentially if I have time)
- Correctness - if both participants are honest, everything works fine.
- Soundness - if I don't know the secret, I cannot prove the statement nor prove I know the secret.
- Zero knowledge - you learn nothing more than the statement that I wanted to prove to you. 

For example, a deck of cards. 26 Black and 26 Red. If I take a card at random and want to prove to you that this card is say red, I can remove 26 black cards from the deck to prove to you that my card is indeed red. You know nothing else about the card other than the statement that I wanted to prove to you; that the card I'm holding is indeed red.
