# ConsenSys-Final-Project

## What does your project do?
This is my submission for the final project for the ConsenSys Developer Academy course of class 2018. I have decided to go with the first suggested project idea which is to create an online marketplace. The marketplace is analogous to that of Amazon or Ebay where shoppers can go and browse stores that have been set up by store owners. Administrators manage the store owners while the store owners manage their own stores.

## How to set it up?
